# AD-home-lab
This is my first introduction to Active Directory. The goal of this lab is to create a Domain Controller VM which will house the AD services along win10 clients. The DC will have 2 NIC, one connected to the internet (VBox's NAT), the other to the internal network which will host our clients.
